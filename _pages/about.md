 Hi there! My name Kristijan Garic, a PhD student at [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government), University of Essex. 
 In my PhD project, I am focusing on developing new theories and models to identify and measure policy learning, by analysing public debates in several countries. 
 The premise of my research is that policy learning can be measured by capturing changes in policy preferences over time, by analysing policy actors (governmental and non-governmental organisations) in policy debates and subsequently, policy subsystems. 
 To measure this, I am using discourse network analysis, an innovative methodological tool developed by [Professor Philip Leifeld](https://www.philipleifeld.com) which combines qualitative text analysis with quantitative network analysis, in combination with other models such as agent-based models, temporal random graph models and other, similar models. I am also interested in both developing and applying network analysis approach to [other fields](https://osf.io/7f5x6/download).



 In addition to my studies, I work as a Survey Data Linkage Officer for Understanding Society, one of the largest longitudinal studies in the world, at [the Institute for Social and Economic Research](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/people/kg20588). At the institute, I also lead [Geography data linkage workshop](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/help/training/geographical-data-linkage/), and contribute to other projects such as [Material Deprivation Dashboard](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/news/2023/10/16/new-material-deprivation-dashboard/)

 Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or learn more about my research.
